## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

- Currently studying @ `HAUT(Henan University of Technology), School of Architecture`, majoring in Architecture Designing, School Year 4 out of 5.
- The architecture is NOT referred to as `Computer Architecture`(such as IA-64), but the professional one;
- I'm an empty-stack coder, which is the opposition to full-stack, I have minimal(barely any) knowledge about coding.
- I spend time on things that interest me.

### Something else

- There's almost no correct pronunciation with this nickname 'nonefffds', just pronounce whatever you'd prefer. Or just call me as "FDS".
- The avatar is Cyanobacteria.
